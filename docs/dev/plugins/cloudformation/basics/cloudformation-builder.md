# CloudFormation Builder

    TODO: Give an introduction to the cloudformation builder.

While CloudFormation templates can be created by hand, in our project we use the cloudformation-builder in order to programmatically create CloudFormation templates.

The cloudformation-builder provides us with the ability to create a java model of a CloudFormation template and the subsequent generation of a valid YAML template corresponding to that java model.
