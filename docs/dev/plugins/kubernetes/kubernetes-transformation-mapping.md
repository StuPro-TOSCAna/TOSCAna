# Kubernetes Transformation Mapping
This document is intended as an overview of the transformation mapping from TOSCA to Kubernetes.

It details the conversion of TOSCA node-, relationship, and capability types to Kubernetes compliant resource files in order to build the target artifact (See [target artifact conventions](..\target-artifact-conventions\target-artifact-conventions.md)). These mapping definitions serve as a base for the automatic transformation implemented by the Kubernetes Plugin which takes place in the **transform**-phase as described in the [transformation lifecycle](..\transformation-lifecycle\transformation-lifecycle.md).

First, the normative and non-normative types and capabilities supported by the Kubernetes Plugin are introduced and their respective transformations explained. Then these transformations are further illustrated by example through a demonstration of the transformation of two complete TOSCA service templates for separate applications.
