# Test Run Configurations

The Run Configurations in this Folder can be copied into th `.idea/runConfigurations/` folder to use. 

They allow you to run:
 - All Unit Tests of the server module
 - All Integration Tests of the server module
 - All Tests of the server module
 - All Tests of the retrofit-wrapper module
 - All Tests of the cli module
 - All Tests (Coverage does not work!)
 
These Configurations need IntelliJ Idea to run!
