*[decision drivers | forces]* <!-- optional -->

## Considered Alternatives

* Support node type definitions
* Don't support node type definitions

## Decision Outcome

* Chosen Alternative: Don't support node types

Supporting node type definitions would be nice, but we can not afford the effort (limited resource).
The benefits are too small.

## Pros and Cons of the Alternatives <!-- optional -->

### Support node type definitions

* `+` more complete implementation of TOSCA
* `-` needs to be developed; is quite complicated

### Don't support node type definitions
